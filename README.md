# Challenge 1

For this challenge, the task is to refactor an existing webpage to make it clearer to read as it is important and best practice for typing clean code.

The impotance of clean code:
* Helps clients and collaborators navigate and read through the code
* Makes it easier to understand each elements and the purpose of each line
* Ensures it more accessible for people with dissabilities 
* Optomized for search engines
* Help the clients avoid litigations

By the end of it, the website should still look the same but the html and css code should look much cleaner and concise.
